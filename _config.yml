              As a Finance Business Partner, I provide strategic financial leadership by collaborating closely with Directors and Heads of Service. My role involves developing robust financial plans that align with the council’s strategic priorities and the Medium-Term Financial Plan (MTFP). I manage the annual budget cycle, ensuring risks and opportunities are effectively identified and addressed, while delivering detailed variance analyses to support operational efficiency. A key focus is on building strong relationships with budget holders, enabling clear communication of financial performance and presenting insights in accessible formats tailored to non-financial audiences. I am also responsible for ensuring compliance with financial policies, introducing process improvements, and enhancing governance standards across the organisation. Additionally, I lead the preparation of timely and accurate reports for both internal and external stakeholders, including updates on capital strategies and statutory submissions, while mentoring finance team members to drive continuous improvement.

              In my role as a Finance Business Partner at Network Rail, I was entrusted with managing the financial oversight of major capital infrastructure projects, some exceeding £500 million in value. I ensured these projects adhered to strict financial regulations and strategic goals, supporting the organisation’s commitment to delivering critical infrastructure efficiently and effectively. 
              
              By conducting in-depth financial reviews and audits, I identified potential risks early, implementing measures to mitigate them while ensuring alignment with operational objectives. My role required balancing robust financial control with the flexibility to support innovative project delivery across the organisation’s diverse portfolio. I developed and maintained comprehensive Power BI dashboards that transformed complex financial data into clear, actionable insights for stakeholders. 
              
              These dashboards enhanced decision-making processes and allowed senior management to monitor performance metrics in real time, improving transparency and accountability across all levels of the business. A key achievement was streamlining reporting workflows, which reduced turnaround times and improved the accuracy of financial performance updates presented to both internal stakeholders and external regulators. Additionally, I played an instrumental role in identifying and implementing cost-saving initiatives that delivered measurable financial efficiencies without compromising the quality or timeliness of project delivery. I collaborated closely with cross-functional project teams, including engineers, planners, and legal advisors, to align financial planning with operational and regulatory objectives. This multidisciplinary approach ensured projects were delivered on time, within budget, and in compliance with governance standards. Regularly engaging with regulatory bodies, I presented detailed financial reports and compliance documentation to demonstrate the organisation’s fiscal responsibility and adherence to statutory obligations. I also supported strategic initiatives by providing financial insights that shaped long-term planning and operational strategy, further reinforcing the organisation’s reputation as a leader in infrastructure management. This role allowed me to hone my skills in stakeholder management, data-driven decision-making, and financial governance within a complex and highly regulated environment.
