            Network Rail's mission is to "put passengers first," aiming to become a company that is on the side of passengers and freight users; that is easy to engage with and is an efficient and dependable partner; a company people are proud to work for; instinctively recognised as an industry leader.
          description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
              In my role as a Finance Business Partner at Network Rail, I was entrusted with managing the financial oversight of major capital infrastructure projects, some exceeding £500 million in value. I ensured these projects adhered to strict financial regulations and strategic goals, supporting the organisation’s commitment to delivering critical infrastructure efficiently and effectively. 
              
              By conducting in-depth financial reviews and audits, I identified potential risks early, implementing measures to mitigate them while ensuring alignment with operational objectives. My role required balancing robust financial control with the flexibility to support innovative project delivery across the organisation’s diverse portfolio. I developed and maintained comprehensive Power BI dashboards that transformed complex financial data into clear, actionable insights for stakeholders. 
              
              These dashboards enhanced decision-making processes and allowed senior management to monitor performance metrics in real time, improving transparency and accountability across all levels of the business. A key achievement was streamlining reporting workflows, which reduced turnaround times and improved the accuracy of financial performance updates presented to both internal stakeholders and external regulators. Additionally, I played an instrumental role in identifying and implementing cost-saving initiatives that delivered measurable financial efficiencies without compromising the quality or timeliness of project delivery. I collaborated closely with cross-functional project teams, including engineers, planners, and legal advisors, to align financial planning with operational and regulatory objectives. 
              
              This multidisciplinary approach ensured projects were delivered on time, within budget, and in compliance with governance standards. Regularly engaging with regulatory bodies, I presented detailed financial reports and compliance documentation to demonstrate the organisation’s fiscal responsibility and adherence to statutory obligations. I also supported strategic initiatives by providing financial insights that shaped long-term planning and operational strategy, further reinforcing the organisation’s reputation as a leader in infrastructure management. This role allowed me to hone my skills in stakeholder management, data-driven decision-making, and financial governance within a complex and highly regulated environment.

              Beyond my day-to-day responsibilities, I was actively involved in supporting the strategic objectives of the NHS's urgent and emergency care services in Northamptonshire. This included facilitating risk management processes, working flexibly across the team to optimise the use of resources, and ensuring that providers met their commitments regarding surge management plans and urgent care delivery. I played an integral role in ensuring that reporting and planning activities were completed within specified timeframes, collaborating with a range of stakeholders to guarantee that project objectives were achieved.
