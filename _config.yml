            West Northamptonshire Council's mission is to make West Northants a great place to live, work, visit, and thrive. 
          description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
              As a Finance Business Partner, I play a pivotal role in providing strategic financial leadership, working closely with Directors, Heads of Service, and key stakeholders to ensure the council’s financial objectives are met. My primary responsibility involves developing robust, forward-looking financial plans that align with the council's strategic priorities and its Medium-Term Financial Plan (MTFP). This requires a thorough understanding of organisational goals, financial pressures, and the broader economic environment, enabling me to create sustainable solutions that balance short-term operational needs with long-term fiscal resilience.
              
              A significant part of my role is managing the annual budget cycle, from initial planning and resource allocation through to final approval and implementation. This involves meticulous analysis to identify risks and opportunities, ensuring they are addressed proactively to maintain financial stability. By conducting detailed variance analyses, I provide actionable insights that support operational efficiency and inform decision-making at all levels. These insights are communicated clearly and concisely, using tailored formats that make financial performance understandable and actionable for non-financial audiences.
              
              Building and maintaining strong relationships with budget holders is a cornerstone of my work. Through regular engagement, I ensure they have the tools, knowledge, and support needed to manage their budgets effectively. This involves not only monitoring performance but also fostering a collaborative environment where financial accountability is embraced, and innovative solutions to financial challenges are encouraged. My ability to present complex financial data in an accessible manner has been instrumental in strengthening these relationships and driving organisational improvement.
              
              Governance and compliance are critical aspects of my role. I am responsible for ensuring adherence to the council's financial policies, as well as national and statutory requirements. To enhance governance standards, I continually seek opportunities to streamline processes, introduce efficiencies, and implement best practices. This includes reviewing and refining internal controls to safeguard assets and mitigate financial risks.
              
              In addition to my operational responsibilities, I lead the preparation of timely and accurate financial reports for a wide range of stakeholders. These include internal management updates, external regulatory submissions, and comprehensive reports on capital strategies. My work ensures transparency and accountability, contributing to informed decision-making across the organisation. I am adept at managing competing priorities to meet strict deadlines without compromising the quality of outputs.
              
              A key aspect of my contribution is the mentoring and development of finance team members. By providing guidance, support, and training, I empower them to excel in their roles and deliver continuous improvement across the finance function. This includes fostering a culture of professional growth, encouraging innovation, and sharing best practices to build a high-performing, future-ready team.
              
              Through my expertise and leadership, I contribute to the council’s ability to navigate financial challenges, achieve its strategic objectives, and deliver value to the community. My role is central to driving financial discipline, enhancing organisational performance, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the council’s financial position.

          description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
              In my role as a Finance Business Partner at Network Rail, I was entrusted with managing the financial oversight of major capital infrastructure projects, some exceeding £500 million in value. I ensured these projects adhered to strict financial regulations and strategic goals, supporting the organisation’s commitment to delivering critical infrastructure efficiently and effectively. 
              
              By conducting in-depth financial reviews and audits, I identified potential risks early, implementing measures to mitigate them while ensuring alignment with operational objectives. My role required balancing robust financial control with the flexibility to support innovative project delivery across the organisation’s diverse portfolio. I developed and maintained comprehensive Power BI dashboards that transformed complex financial data into clear, actionable insights for stakeholders. 
              
              These dashboards enhanced decision-making processes and allowed senior management to monitor performance metrics in real time, improving transparency and accountability across all levels of the business. A key achievement was streamlining reporting workflows, which reduced turnaround times and improved the accuracy of financial performance updates presented to both internal stakeholders and external regulators. Additionally, I played an instrumental role in identifying and implementing cost-saving initiatives that delivered measurable financial efficiencies without compromising the quality or timeliness of project delivery. I collaborated closely with cross-functional project teams, including engineers, planners, and legal advisors, to align financial planning with operational and regulatory objectives. 
              
              This multidisciplinary approach ensured projects were delivered on time, within budget, and in compliance with governance standards. Regularly engaging with regulatory bodies, I presented detailed financial reports and compliance documentation to demonstrate the organisation’s fiscal responsibility and adherence to statutory obligations. I also supported strategic initiatives by providing financial insights that shaped long-term planning and operational strategy, further reinforcing the organisation’s reputation as a leader in infrastructure management. This role allowed me to hone my skills in stakeholder management, data-driven decision-making, and financial governance within a complex and highly regulated environment.

            The NHS's mission is to provide comprehensive, high-quality, patient-centered healthcare that is accessible to all, based on clinical need, while upholding principles of excellence, professionalism, and accountability.
          description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
              Implementation of a surge management and resilience system for the NHS in Northamptonshire involved a comprehensive and strategic approach to improving the region's capability to handle periods of heightened demand. This project required close coordination with multiple stakeholders, including NHS England, the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), and local healthcare providers, to ensure that processes and systems were aligned with national standards and local healthcare needs.
              
              I was responsible for overseeing the monitoring of providers' progress on Urgent Care and Surge Management plans, ensuring that they remained on track to meet key milestones. This involved regular reviews of performance metrics, identifying potential areas of concern, and implementing corrective actions where necessary. To maintain accountability and transparency, I provided detailed and timely reporting to NHS England and the CCG on a daily basis, presenting clear insights and data to support decision-making and resource allocation.
              
              A key component of this role was fostering a culture of continuous improvement across the healthcare network. I facilitated the sharing of best practices among providers, encouraging collaboration and innovation to enhance service delivery and patient care. This included organizing workshops, creating knowledge-sharing platforms, and developing case studies that highlighted successful initiatives.
              
              In addition, I managed risk processes to ensure that any potential disruptions or vulnerabilities were identified and mitigated promptly. This required developing robust control systems that emphasized data integrity, functionality, and governance. By implementing strong data validation processes and governance frameworks, I ensured that all reporting and decision-making were based on accurate and reliable information.
              
              I worked to align the surge management system with the wider strategic objectives of the NHS, focusing on building resilience and sustainability within Northamptonshire's healthcare infrastructure. This entailed integrating various operational components, such as patient flow management, resource allocation, and staff deployment, into a cohesive and responsive framework. My efforts helped create a resilient healthcare ecosystem capable of adapting to unforeseen challenges while maintaining high standards of care.

              The role was centred around the comprehensive management of IT infrastructure and Salesforce systems, ensuring they were maintained, configured, and deployed to achieve optimal performance. This required a detailed understanding of both the technical and operational aspects of the organisation's systems. My responsibilities included overseeing the entire configuration and deployment process, ensuring the systems were tailored to meet the organisation's specific needs and functioned efficiently under varying conditions.
              
              A significant part of the role was delivering Salesforce training to staff at all levels, ensuring users were confident and proficient in utilising the platform's capabilities to enhance their productivity. This involved creating training materials, conducting interactive sessions, and providing ongoing support to address any challenges. Additionally, I conducted regular quality assurance reviews to prepare for audits, ensuring all processes and systems adhered to regulatory requirements and best practices.
              
              My role extended to analysing operational data to identify trends and areas for improvement. I used this data to streamline workflows, enhance productivity, and inform strategic decision-making. This involved creating customised dashboards and automated reports that provided real-time insights into key performance indicators, enabling teams to make informed decisions quickly and effectively.
              
              Collaboration with external stakeholders was another critical aspect of my work, particularly when addressing system-related issues. I liaised with vendors and service providers to ensure timely resolution of technical problems and to explore opportunities for system enhancements. This collaborative approach was essential for maintaining the reliability and efficiency of the organisation's IT infrastructure.
              
              In addition to technical management, I was responsible for overseeing the Information Systems (IS) budget, ensuring all expenditures were aligned with organisational priorities and delivered maximum value. This included negotiating contracts with suppliers to achieve cost savings while maintaining high standards of service. My efforts resulted in significant financial efficiencies and ensured the long-term sustainability of the organisation's IT operations.
              
              Leading system upgrades was a key aspect of my role, requiring meticulous planning and execution to minimise disruption while maximising benefits. I implemented industry best practices for data management and governance, ensuring all data was accurate, secure, and compliant with legal and ethical standards. This involved developing robust policies and procedures, as well as conducting regular audits to monitor compliance.
              
              Throughout my tenure, I was committed to driving continuous improvement, fostering a culture of innovation, and ensuring that the organisation’s IT and Salesforce systems remained at the forefront of technological advancements. My work not only enhanced system performance but also contributed significantly to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the organisation’s operations.
